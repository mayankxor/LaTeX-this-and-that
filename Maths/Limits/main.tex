This book intends to teach the subject of \textit{Calculus} in such a way that it feels like \textbf{"discovering"} maths. Something that you could have discovered yourself, all it takes is some self confidence and immense curiosity. This book might not feel like a standard textbook and shall not be used as such. Its more targeted towards people who want to get a taste of starting from scratch and building on them.
